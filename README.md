# Code-Tracker
Codetracker is a lightweight web app to track progress across 50 lessons: 1–30 HTML‑only projects and 31–50 CSS roadmap projects. JavaScript isn’t part of the curriculum, the focus is mastering HTML &amp; CSS. Built with HTML, CSS, and JS, it features checkboxes, notes, filters, and a live progress bar with localStorage.
